Intro To Microcontroller And Ardiuno
- Microcontroller: 
Microcontroller is a component used to control the electronics, programmable and able to connect with other digital parts.
You can program the chips and microcontrollers by using the programming languages.
- Arduino:
Arduino is an electronic board used to control the devices and many components. It made up of microcontroller, chips, PWM pin, analog pin,....
To program the arduino, the user used a program called Arduino IDE.

Start Downloading Arduino IDE
First, go to Google chrome and search arduino.cc.
Next, click download and start download for Window or MacBook.
Then, after finished loading and installed the program open it.
Finally, open the program and you will see something look like the photo above.

First Step To Programming Arduino
The first program you will code is the program above
I know that you have no idea about what is it, but donâ€™t worry my friend.
Explanation:
Const int ledPin = 13; = Creating an variable called ledPin that has an integer value which is pin digital 13.
pinMode(ledPin,OUTPUT); means that you make the ledPin to the ledPin as an OUTPUT.
digitalWrite(ledPin,HIGH); means that you make the voltage to be HIGH.
digitalWrite(ledPin,LOW); means that you define the output voltage to be LOW.
delay(200); means that you make a delay time between HIGH voltage and LOW voltage. In this case, 200 millisecond.
void setup(){ is the class

Basic infos about Arduino
The best arduino board for beginners is Arduino UNO. This is the first board that you need.
https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/arduinoBoardUno&gt; - Is The Website That Contains The Basic Informations About Arduino Uno
Remember to have an Arduino Uno board. To program the Arduino you need to connect the computer to the board by the USB cable. Execute to program it.
